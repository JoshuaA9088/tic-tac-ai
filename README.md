# TicTacAI

Implementation of the simple algorithm minimax to solve TicTacToe. Written in
both C++ and Python (and soon hopefully more languages).

Much of the initial inspiration came from this excellent implementation and
write-up of the minimax algorithm, by
[Cledersonbc](https://github.com/Cledersonbc/tic-tac-toe-minimax). Be sure to
check it out!

Each language's implementation has its own subdirectory with relevant
documentation.
